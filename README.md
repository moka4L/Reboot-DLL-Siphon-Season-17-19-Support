# RebootDLL-Siphon-Season17-19-Support
This is a modded frost dll and it is made to work on 17.30 and 19.10. Read more below.

The DLL itself does not have a fix for the "storm bug" and knockback however I do have another repository where you can add a fix for both of these. This is done through your backend though but definetly check that out!

I somehow forgot and lost the source code to this so yeahhhhhhhhhhh.....                                 (but atleast you can download it)
